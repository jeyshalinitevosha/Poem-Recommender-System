# Poem-Recommneder-System
A Poem Recommender System using Text Similarity


Our Poem Recommender System will help the users to get various recommendations on poems based on the poem name the user input in our system. Once the user input the poem name, it derives the similarity of the poem from its contents and introduces the concept of TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). We make clusters of similar poems using the KMeans and Mini Batch KMeans Clustering. The similarity between the poems was evaluated by calculating the cosine similarity. Later, the clusters made were used to make recommendations to the user. The users can view and read the poems available in our database.
