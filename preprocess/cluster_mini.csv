Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summers lease hath all too short a date;
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance or natures changing course untrimm'd;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owst;
Nor shall death brag thou wanderst in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou growst:
   So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
   So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.",shall compare thee summer day thou art lovely temperate rough wind shake darling bud may summer lease hath short date sometime hot eye heaven shine often gold complexion dimmed every fair fair sometime decline chance nature changing course untried thy eternal summer shall fade lose possession fair thou shall death brag thou wanders shade eternal line time thou grows long men breathe eye see long life give life thee,4,59

Red overwrought with orange and all made

But sings not out the song, nor knows
The maker of it, some other mouth,
